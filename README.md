# nus3audio-to-flac

This is a simple batch converter that converts nus3audio files to flac files. It isn't completed yet, however.

**Anything in /tmp will be deleted once the program ends. Do not store any files there.**

## Usage

First, edit the settings in config.txt to your liking. NUM_LOOPS is the number of loops the song will do through (decimals are valid), and FADE_DURATION is the amount of time in seconds that it will fade out near the end. If the song loops, this time will be added onto the song.
